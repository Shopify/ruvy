This crate is `no_std` so doesn't use any side-effectful std functions. It
contains quite a lot of `unsafe` code, however. I verified portions of this. It
also has a large, thorough test suite. The project claims to run tests with
Miri to have stronger soundness checks, and also claims to use formal
verification tools to prove correctness.
