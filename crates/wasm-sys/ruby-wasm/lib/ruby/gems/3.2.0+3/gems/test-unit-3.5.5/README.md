## Description

An xUnit family unit testing framework for Ruby.

test-unit (Test::Unit) is unit testing framework for Ruby, based on xUnit
principles. These were originally designed by Kent Beck, creator of extreme
programming software development methodology, for Smalltalk's SUnit. It allows
writing tests, checking results and automated testing in Ruby.

test-unit ships as part of Ruby as a bundled gem. To check which version is included, see https://stdgems.org/test-unit/.
It's only necessary to install the gem if you need a newer version.

test-unit is the original Ruby unit testing library, and is still active.
It is one of two unit testing libraries bundled with Ruby, the other being [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest).

When deciding which to use, consider:

* test-unit is strict about backwards compatibility. A backwards-incompatible change would be considered a bug.
* test-unit aims to support old Ruby versions, even if EOL.

## Features

* test-unit 1.2.3 is the original test-unit, taken
  straight from the ruby distribution. It is being
  distributed as a gem to allow tool builders to use it as a
  stand-alone package. (The test framework in ruby is going
  to radically change very soon).

* test-unit will be improved actively and may break
  compatibility with test-unit 1.2.3. (We will not hope it
  if it isn't needed.)

* Some features exist as separated gems like GUI test
  runner. (Tk, GTK+ and Fox) test-unit-full gem package
  provides for installing all test-unit related gems
  easily.
